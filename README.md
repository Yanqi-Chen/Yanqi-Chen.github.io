A [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog template made for simple, readable snippets of your brain drippings.

[DEMO](http://adueck.github.io/cayman-blog/)

To get this going follow these simple steps:

1. Fork, clone, or download the repository
2. Edit <code>_config.yml</code>
3. If you want, swap `img/cover.jpg` for your own header image
3. Fill up the `_posts` folder with whatever you want to say
4. run <code>jekyll build</code> and then <code>jekyll serve</code>  
note: This will require the `jekyll-paginate` gem `$ gem install jekyll-paginate`

You can easily host your blog for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

I made this Jekyll theme by adapting and modifying the [Cayman Theme](https://github.com/jasonlong/cayman-theme) by [Jason Lang](https://github.com/jasonlong), which is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
